  <h1> Celebrity Resemblance Classification Model </h1>

## Description:
This project is the works done during my internship at [Cloud x Lab](https://cloudxlab.com/home), India. This project uses the face-recognition library in Python to find a celebrity look-alike from a picture that is being uploaded. The face-recognition library is built using `dlibâ€™s` state-of-the-art face recognition which uses `CNN` to classify several types of touch interaction from humans by learning the data pattern from a force sensor. The model had **98.38%** computing similarity when tested on two distinct metrics based approaches such as Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance.
